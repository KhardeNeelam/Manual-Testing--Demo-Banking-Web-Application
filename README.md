# Demo Banking Web Application – Functional Testing (Manual QA Project)

## Project Overview
This project focused on validating core banking functionalities for **Manager** and **Customer** roles in a demo banking application (Guru99).  
Testing emphasized **form validations, field-level error handling, and functional workflows** aligned with the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

## Objective
To ensure compliance-driven QA by designing, executing, and documenting test cases that validate critical banking operations.

## Modules Covered
- New Customer Creation  
- Account Management (Create / Edit / Delete)  
- Fund Transfer

- Mini & Customized Statements  
- Password Change  
- Customer & Account Deletion  

## Techniques Applied
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)  
- Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)  
- Decision Table Testing  
- State Transition Testing  
- Use Case Testing  

## Test Artifacts
- **Test Scenarios** – module-wise breakdown of coverage  
- **Test Cases** – Excel-based with steps, data, expected results  
- **Execution Reports** – pass/fail tracking and defect identification  

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – Test case design & execution tracking  
- Microsoft Word – SRS and summary documentation  
- Google Chrome (latest stable version, 2024) – Manual functional testing  

## Key Achievements
- Designed and executed **40+ test cases** across **17 scenarios**
